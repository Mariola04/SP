## Project structure and files sent

We decided to send a pdf version of our notebook as the most optimal way of displaying our project, but we also sent a runnable version of our notebook.

We opted do do this because on the execution of some algorithms we had some run time spikes due to background processes happening simultaneously that were using the memory of our computer, we also explained this on the comments that we have on the code.

To run our project you just have to open the file on your prefered IDE and simply execute it.
