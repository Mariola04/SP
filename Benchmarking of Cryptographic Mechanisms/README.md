## Project structure and files sent

The file in this repository is a notebook that contains all the work done for this assignment, if you decide to clone the repo and run it yourself there may be some changes in the runtime due to different laptop/pc specs

The project resolves around benchmarking the encrypt and decrypt time of 3 different algorithms (AES, RSA, SHA) and also a few experiments on things that may affect the runtimes of the said algorithms 

To run our project you just have to open the file on your prefered IDE and simply execute it
